## Today's reading

- Wandell, B. A., Dumoulin, S. O., & Brewer, A. A. (2007). Visual field maps in human cortex. *Neuron*, *56*(2), 366–383. Retrieved from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2007.10.012

## Questions to ponder

- What are visual field maps?
- How are they measured or acquired? 
- How does this method compare with single unit recordings? 
- What do visual field maps tell us about the function of visual cortex?

<!-- ## Other questions to ponder -->

<!-- - What's the goal of visual neuroscience? -->
<!-- - What's a receptive field? -->
<!-- - What made 'simple' cells simple? -->
<!--     + How were cortical 'simple' cells different from LGN and retinal cells? -->
<!-- - What made 'complex' cells complex? -->

<!-- ## More questions to ponder -->

<!-- - How does the size of receptive fields vary? -->
<!-- - What is direction selectivity? -->
<!-- - What is ocular dominance? -->

<!-- ## Key points -->

<!--   > "...with the exception of afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate body we have found no units with concentric 'on'-centre or 'off'-centre fields." p.109 -->

<!--   > "...By trial and error with many shapes of stimulus it was discovered that the cell's firing could be influenced by a horizontally oriented slit..." p. 114 -->

<!--   > "In describing simple fields it has already been noted that moving stimuli were often more effective than stationary ones. This was also true of cells with complex fields." p. 121 -->

<!-- --- -->

<!--   > "...in both geniculate and cortex the field dimensions tend to increase with distance from the area centralis, and that they differ even for a given location in the retina." p. 122 -->

<!--   > "...the only differences ever seen between the two fields were related to eye dominance: identical stimuli to the two eyes did not necessarily evoke equally strong responses from a given cell." p. 124 -->

<!--   > "...the striate cortex is divided into discrete regions within which the cells have a common receptive-field axis orientation." p. 133 -->

<!-- --- -->

<!--   > "Cells with simple fields were most numerous in layers 3, 4 and 6. Especially interesting is the apparent rarity of complex fields in layer 4, where simple fields were so abundant." p. 139 -->

<!--   > "We may tentatively look upon each column as a functional unit of cortex, within which simple fields are elaborated and then in turn synthesized into complex fields." p. 144 -->
